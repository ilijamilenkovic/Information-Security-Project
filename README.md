# Information-Security-Project
Project for Information Security class
Implemented encryption algorithms such as TEA, Rc4 (with and without parallelization) and Enigma.
Implemented error detecting code - CRC.
For some algorithms it is possible to use Block cipher mode (CBC is implemented).
It supports working with plain text inputed trough Windows form, .txt files and .bmp files.
